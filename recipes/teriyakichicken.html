    <p> An easy to make and delicious family-favourite.</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp water</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1.75 lbs boneless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Method</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the marinade first. Stir together the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, garlic, ginger, and 1 Tbsp of the cooking oil in a bowl.</li>
        <br><li>Place the chicken in a shallow bowl or dish, then pour the marinade over top. Turn the chicken a couple of times to make sure it's well coated. Let the chicken marinate for 30 minutes to one day (refrigerated), turning the chicken occasionally as it marinates.</li>
        <br><li>When ready to cook the chicken, heat the remaining 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the chicken, discarding the remaining used marinade.</li>
        <br><li>Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side or until cooked through and the liquid in the skillet has reduced to a light coating of glaze on the chicken.</li>
        <br><li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
