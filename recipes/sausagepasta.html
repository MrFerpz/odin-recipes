    <p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>1 small yellow onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 lb Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 lb pasta</li>
        <li>3 lb baby spinach</li>
        <li>Grated parmesan for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Method</b></p>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, dice 1 small yellow onion. Mince 3 garlic cloves. Remove the casings from 1 pound uncooked Italian sausage if needed.</li>
        <br><li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan or high-sided sauté pan over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and sauté until softened and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes if desired and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <br><li>Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula into small pieces, until cooked through, about 6 minutes. Carefully pour in 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes. Add 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <br><li>Reduce the heat to low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, while you cook the pasta. Add 1 pound dried short pasta to the boiling water and according to package directions until al dente. Drain and return to the now-empty pot off the heat.</li>
        <br><li>Add the sauce to the pasta and toss gently to combine. Add 3 ounces baby spinach a handful or two at a time, stirring between each addition, until the spinach is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve garnished generously with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
